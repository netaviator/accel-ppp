"""on-demand targets: the idle linger that closes a tunnel after its last call.

An on-demand target connects because a call needs it (see
test_switch_on_demand_connect.py); this file covers the other half of that
lifecycle -- what happens to the tunnel once the *last* call on it ends.

Neither of the two obvious extremes is acceptable:

  * closing the tunnel the instant the last call ends makes every
    back-to-back call pay a fresh SCCRQ round trip, and turns a busy target
    into a connect/disconnect flap of accel-ppp's own making;
  * never closing it leaves a session-less tunnel sitting there for the
    downstream peer's own idle policy to tear down on *its* terms (JunOS'
    default 60s `idle-timeout`) -- the production bug this whole feature
    exists to avoid.

So the contract is a bounded window: the tunnel stays up for ~20s after the
last call ends, and a call arriving inside that window reuses it and starts
the window again from its own end. Both tests below are therefore about
*when* things happen, not just that they eventually do.

The downstream here is the peer harness's `--listen --hold-seconds` mode, not
a second accel-ppp instance, for one blunt reason: accel-ppp itself
disconnects any tunnel the moment its last session goes away, so a downstream
accel-ppp always closes the tunnel a few hundred milliseconds after the call
ends -- before any linger of the switch's own can be observed at all
(verified: the tunnel went [down] ~1s after the call, on the *downstream's*
StopCCN). Real peers are patient enough to leave that decision to us, which
is exactly what the harness plays here.
