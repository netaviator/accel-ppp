    payload into the downstream leg's kernel socket. That socket belongs to
    the downstream tunnel's context, which closes it (call teardown) with no
    synchronization against the upstream tunnel's context doing the splice --
    so the fd number the splice was about to use can be closed, and handed out
    again by an unrelated open() (here: a new CLI connection), between the
    moment it was loaded and the splice() that writes to it. The payload then
    lands on whatever now has that number.

    That window is nanoseconds wide, so the shim stretches it: it delays the
    upstream leg's splice of the marked payload by SHIM_DELAY_MS (and does
    nothing else -- the fd number is still the one the daemon passed in). In
    that time the downstream target ends the call, and this test opens fresh
    connections to the daemon's CLI port. The payload must not show up on any
