    """l2tp_switch_link_write_out() splices a switched call's payload from its
    pipe into the destination leg's socket. On EAGAIN (destination not
    writable) it waits with a blocking poll(), synchronously, on the SOURCE
    tunnel's own triton context -- which is also what runs that tunnel's CLI
    handling and every other session on it. So a single backpressured call
    should not be able to make the whole tunnel (here: the whole daemon,
    thread-count=1 so there is nowhere else for anything to run) unresponsive
    for as long as the backpressure lasts.

    The downstream leg here is a real target, so the call actually completes
    -- there is no slow reader to build with this harness, so backpressure is
    injected directly with an LD_PRELOAD shim that makes splice() itself
    return EAGAIN for this call's marked payload for EAGAIN_WINDOW_MS, then
    lets it through -- reproducing "destination socket not writable" without
    needing one.
